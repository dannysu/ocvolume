OrangeCow (OC) organization would like to thank
several people that contributed in the success
of this OC Volume release. This project would
probably not be complete without their
assistance and willingness to help us as much
as they can.

Thanks go to:

Chris Duff
- He is a computer teacher at Thornlea
  Secondary School. He motivated and pushed us
  beyond our limits to do the best we can do.

Nick Fernandes
- He is a computer teacher at Thornlea
  Secondary School. He helped us by giving us
  his opinions and suggestions on the project.

David Martínez Nieto
- He worked on an implementation of the Hidden
  Markov Chains in voice recognition for low
  power emmbedded systems (project webpage:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/m68kvrs/). He
  helped us with questions about Hidden Markov
  Models.

Tor M. Aamodt
- He is a PhD student at University of Toronto
  (his home page:
  http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~aamodt/ece341/speech-recognition/).
  He gave valuable suggestions to where might
  be the problem with our recognition system.
  He suggested that we use MATLAB to verify the
  Digital Signal Processing results and told us
  that Hidden Markov Models can be used to deal
  time variation problems.

Tim Lin
- He is a student at University of Waterloo
  studying computer science. He suggested us
  not to use Neural Networks but find
  alternatives. His support also contributed a
  lot to our success.

Also, the we would like to thank Thornlea
Secondary School for providing us with their
computer lab.
