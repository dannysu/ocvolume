OC Volume version 1.0.1 README
------------------------------

WHAT is OC Volume?
------------------
OC Volume is the first software released by
OrangeCow. The aim of this program is to enable
voice communication with computers. OC Volume
is a speech recognition engine written in Java,
and should be integrated with other
applications to create voice-driven software.

WHEN did we start the project?
------------------------------
The OC Volume project started on March 28,
2002.

WHEN did the project finish?
----------------------------
This project will never finish since there is
still a "life" after we finish coding. We
receive feedbacks from the users of OC Volume,
and we still provide help to people who want
to use our software. Please send us an email
about how you're using OC Volume, we would
love to hear about it!

WHY free and open-source?
-------------------------
We have benefited from many open-source
projects, either directly or indirectly.
Therefore our aim is not to make profit but
to learn and to contribute back to the
open-source community.
