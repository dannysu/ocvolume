February 15, 2004 - Changed from LGPL to BSD license and various updates
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first update in a while. There are some minor changes listed
below:

* OCV license changed from LGPL to BSD license, which gives much more
  freedom.

* The links page had several dead links, and they are either fixed or
  removed.

* There was a mistake made in fft.java that has been fixed. Apparently,
  the fast fourier transform function has a bug in the bit reversal
  sorting code. It was discovered when I was re-using the fft function
  to perform fast polynomial multiplication. Use a diff tool to compare
  old version to new version to see the difference.

I (Danny) am starting to work on improvements for original OCV code, but
this time coding it in C. There may be a Java API once and if I do
finish. My aim is to have a working Hidden Markov Model module for
training and try to make the recognizer less speaker dependent.

June 28, 2002 - First release of complete package  
-------------------------------------------------
We release the complete package to the public.
Although this initial package contains only an
Isolated Word Recognizer, it will become more
sophisticated as we add more capability to the
engine.  

May 23, 2002 - Completion of Vector Quantization component
----------------------------------------------------------
We finished programming the Feature Extraction component
and use it to extract Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
from speech signal.

May 5, 2002 - Completion of Hidden Markov Models component
----------------------------------------------------------
We finished programming the Discrete Hidden Markov Models
for our speech recognition engine.

March 28, 2002 - Project started
--------------------------------
We started doing preliminary
research on speech recognition.
